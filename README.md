This project was created as part of my Python learning journey.

### 🎯 WHY THIS MATCHES WHAT YOU SHOWED

✔ Image shown **directly** (no link)  
✔ Clean spacing  
✔ Short sections  
✔ Visual-first  
✔ No unnecessary text  
✔ Looks good when scrolling  
✔ Recruiter/teacher friendly  

This is **exactly the same cleanliness level** as the Computer Vision README you shared — just adapted for a **QR project**.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT (So image renders properly)
- Branch: **master**
- Image path must be **exactly**:

### output/qrcode.png
- Case-sensitive (GitHub is strict)

If you want next (your choice):
- Make it **even more minimal**
- Add **side-by-side input/output style**
- Add **badges (but clean ones)**
- Convert this into a **college submission format**

Just tell me 👍
